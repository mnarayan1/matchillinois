**Team Formation Algorithm üîç :**

- **Weighted Preferences:**
  - Users are assigned to project areas (e.g., Web Dev, Data Analytics) based on their preferences.
  - Preferences are weighted to give higher priority to stronger interests.

- **BERTopic:**
  - Utilizes advanced NLP to model topics from project descriptions.
  - Groups project descriptions into topics for better team alignment based on content.

- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):**
  - Applied to descriptions where BERTopic is unable to define clear topics.
  - Further categorizes projects to ensure all descriptions are grouped into coherent topics.

The algorithm aims to create balanced teams where each member‚Äôs preferences and project topics are well represented.
